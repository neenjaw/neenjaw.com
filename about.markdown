### **my motto**

We win when my **work** brings **value** to you.

### **my values**

**People**, **technology**, **learning**, and **leadership** are the values which define my accomplishments.

- How can I help you? _Can we work together?_
- How does this work for you? _Is there a way to improve this process?_
- Where can we find the answers? _Who are the knowledge experts?_
- How can we build on something? _Is there another way to view the problem?_
- How do my actions affect others? _Is there a value-conflict?_

### **my education**

I have two bachelor of science degrees: one in computer science, one in nursing. I enjoy problem solving in the physical biology and tech domains.

### quick facts

> Windows or \*nix?

Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04.

> vim or emacs?

vim, but I've used emacs when playing around with [_common-lisp_'s _slime_](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) repl, and it was nice.

> tabs or spaces

I like the compactness of spaces, but there is a semantic use for tabs which I can appreciate.
