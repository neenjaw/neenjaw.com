## Commentary

As I am working through the flexbox guide, i like that I feel like I can create a consistent, modern style with css without just copying everything or relying on bootstrap to do it for me. If anything, the practice with the CSS making real world type tasks is great.

Also, mongoose is great, makes express very fast to develop websites. Did the three lectures by watching the introductory objectives, pausing, then attempting to do it through the docs/api/memory and it turned out it is extremely intuitive once you have the express/mongoose pattern down.
