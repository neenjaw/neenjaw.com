- Webdev - Up to 287

## Commentary

Enjoyed day 10 of the 30-day challenge, I really liked that I was able to figure out a solution all out myself. I can really appreciate his solution though, some of the things like knowing that DOM events have a shift key modifier attribute? I wouldn't have even thought to look for that, though his solution is likely the way most people use shift clicking for multiple items. At the very least, it feels like I am really starting to know the DOM and be useful and effective.

Interesting to see how the implementation of yelpcamp is coming along, the instructor has a plan for fleshing it all out, but he hasn’t really outlined very robust steps for developing a website like this from scratch. Would be great to see an implementation plan. For example:

1. Define basic website flow
2. Define Schemas
3. Define basic controller interactions / state map / process maps
4. Define RESTful routes
5. Create basic file structure
6. Create boilerplate

THEN!

- Npm init
- Install express, mongoose, etc…
- Setup nodemon, refreshify
- Setup grunt tasks/webpack
- Create basic landing page
  - Determine CSS framework (if any) -- Semantic UI / Bootstrap
  - Determine template engine -- ejs vs handlebar
  - Start fleshing out RESTful routes

Maybe that’s just the limitation of this type of learning environment and since his priority is bite-sized introduction to the technologies used for modern web design.
