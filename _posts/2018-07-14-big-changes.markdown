Whew, been a while since any update on here.

What I can say is that there has been a lot going on. Relocated back to Saskatoon, SK. Started orienting to a new nursing job. Bought our first house.

Any one who has ever moved a household knows how much work it has been. What I can say is that I have been slowly working through a couple of interesting coding things on the side when I have had some down time.

## 1. Semi-production shift tracker

I have a working version of the icu shift tracker, inputting a modified dataset that approximates the real-world dataset that might be used. It's really neat to see a lot of data, and how that may change how it is used or what needs to happen in its future development.

The goal is to have a version with data to present at [CACCN Dynamics](https://www.caccn.ca/dynamics2018-calgary/index.html) to show just what can be done with technology to reallocate nursing administrative tasks to help improve decision making for nurse allocation.

## 2. Free Code Camp

I started working on the projects to challenge the first certification for the course. They are fairly basic HTML/CSS/JS implementations of websites, forms, flexbox/grid layouts with basic responsiveness.

I've finished the first one -- a basic article layout with some responsive image sizing -- and started work on the second one -- a two-column form.

## 3. Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Still working through the [D3](https://d3js.org/) sections. It's an interesting take on data visualization. Very handy little syntaxes, and I am looking forward to using it to learn how to work with dynamic SVG manipulations.

On a personal note, I am really enjoying the transition back to Saskatoon. Alberta has been great to us over the past 6 years, and don't really know what life would be like if we hadn't left, but I'm looking forward to the opportunites being back opens up for my family.
